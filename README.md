## Asidlale

This repo includes anonymized data and analysis of the [iThemba Projects'](http://www.ithembaprojects.org.za/splash-page.html) Asidlale Creche Programme in Sweetwaters, South Africa. Data was collected between 2013-2016 from 276 students entering grade R at two primary schools in Sweetwaters. Each student was assessed on 14 exercises involving cognition and motor skills, receiving a score from 1 (low) to 3 (high).


### Goals:

1) Evaluate the effectiveness of the Asidlale programme.

2) Find year-to-year trends to assess how creches have fared over time.

3) Offer suggestions for improving the Asidlale programme.

4) Offer suggestions for improving data collection.


### Key Results:

1) Children in Asdidlale creches consistently outperform peers in non-Asidlale creches.

2) Children who attend any kind of creche consistently outperform peers who do not.

3) Year to year comparisons are difficult to make.
